Very sturdy. I thought it was good for the price. Video would have helped with setup but I figured it out.,0.2382,Negative
"Pros: Good Storage Space
Beautiful, strong shelves/racks.
Cons: Few manufacturing defects.
Supporting pipes are thin & bit uneven. Thus tough in assembling straight with rack allignment.
Rubber clamps/clips are defective & Poor Quality. No extra pieces provided so if break by chance while assembling, becomes problematic & cause of return.
Assembling due to mentioned weakness bit chaotic. Manufacturers hv to work on this to increase sale & avoid returns.
Took me three rounds of dismantling & assembling to finally work. One more thing it's given each shelf can hold approx 160 kg but manual received with product tells of 75kg capacity.
But yes Quality & look wise wise it's quite good specially racks.",0.9431,Positive
"I am very happy with the design and the ease with which the rack could be assembled. I haven't loaded it yet, but it feels sturdy though",0.5017,Negative
"1. Well designed unit with clear self-assembly instructions. Unit comes with screw type stands, clip type shelf load bearers and 4 shelves which have apertures at the end for sliding into place. So Screw drivers, hammers or other tools are not required for assembly. just bare hands and ability to follow instructions are sufficient.
2. It took me 30 minutes to piece the shelves together without tools. So someone with better capabilities will be able to put the unit together faster .
3. The main part here is placing the clips to hold the shelves at proper intervals and on all four sides of the stand. once that is done, adding the shelves are really easy.
4. Except for the base and clips which are of plastic, the entire stand is of steel. you can arrange the spacing of each shelf according to your requirements. Each shelf is sturdy and can bear at minimum 15 kgs of load (my assessment). I have loaded about 15 kgs of provisions on the middle shelf and the structure is not complaining. also it is not leaning / swaying or bending due to this load. so safe to assume that the weight added per shelf is comfy.
5. besides shear/ strength/ sturdiness, the shelves can be cleaned as it is SS. Space obtained from the assembled unit is humongous.

A couple of nice to have points:
1. Weight bearing, lockable castor wheels would have been even more fantastic
2. The shelves are made up of steel rods- like in modular kitchen drawers. 1 or 2 shelves with solid SS base plates without gaps would have been helpful as per my observation.
That said, this unit is sturdy, provides utility and vfm in a single package. hence is a good buy.

"It is very loose, no way to tighten it. No use. Don’t know, all the parts are very strong but no way to fix it tightly. If you provide a video would be helpful. Ok",0.3492,Negative

"The rack arrived nicely packed. It was very simple to assemble. Will take around 15 mins.

I mainly purchased this to keep my plants and terrariums.

If you are keeping heavy items then better to keep it in the lower sections.",0.5574,Negative
