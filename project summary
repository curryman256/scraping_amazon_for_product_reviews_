Amazon Review Scraper and Sentiment Analysis (note: the site was scraped for reviews without an api)
Project Overview
This project is designed to scrape customer reviews from Amazon product pages, analyze sentiment, and visualize sentiment distribution using Python. It leverages web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and data visualization techniques to understand customer opinions on products.

Tech Stack & Libraries Used
Python – Core programming language
Requests – Fetching Amazon web pages
BeautifulSoup – Extracting review data from HTML
NLTK (VADER) – Sentiment analysis
Deep Translator – Translating non-English reviews
Pandas – Data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Time & Regex – Handling request delays and text preprocessing

Project Workflow:
1️⃣ Web Scraping Amazon Reviews
Fetches review pages using the Requests library.
Parses HTML with BeautifulSoup to extract customer reviews.
Implements pagination handling to scrape multiple pages.
Includes headers to bypass bot detection and avoid blocking.
2️⃣ Text Processing & Cleaning
Converts review text to lowercase.
Removes special characters and extra spaces using regular expressions.
Uses Google Translator API to convert non-English reviews to English.
3️⃣ Sentiment Analysis with NLTK
Utilizes VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to classify reviews as:
Positive (Score > 0.05)
Negative (Score < -0.05)
Neutral (Between -0.05 and 0.05)
4️⃣ Data Visualization
Generates a bar chart to show sentiment distribution.
Creates a histogram of sentiment scores to understand polarity. Sample Output & Insights
✅ Successfully scraped customer reviews from Amazon.
✅ Performed sentiment classification into Positive, Neutral, and Negative.
