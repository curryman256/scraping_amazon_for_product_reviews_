1,pros good storage spacebeautiful strong shelvesrackscons few manufacturing defectssupporting pipes are thin bit uneven thus tough in assembling straight with rack allignmentrubber clampsclips are defective poor quality no extra pieces provided so if break by chance while assembling becomes problematic cause of returnassembling due to mentioned weakness bit chaotic manufacturers hv to work on this to increase sale avoid returnstook me three rounds of dismantling assembling to finally work one more thing its given each shelf can hold approx 160 kg but manual received with product tells of 75kg capacitybut yes quality look wise wise its quite good specially racksread more,0.9186,Positive

3,1 well designed unit with clear selfassembly instructions unit comes with screw type stands clip type shelf load bearers and 4 shelves which have apertures at the end for sliding into place so screw drivers hammers or other tools are not required for assembly just bare hands and ability to follow instructions are sufficient2 it took me 30 minutes to piece the shelves together without tools so someone with better capabilities will be able to put the unit together faster 3 the main part here is placing the clips to hold the shelves at proper intervals and on all four sides of the stand once that is done adding the shelves are really easy4 except for the base and clips which are of plastic the entire stand is of steel you can arrange the spacing of each shelf according to your requirements each shelf is sturdy and can bear at minimum 15 kgs of load my assessment i have loaded about 15 kgs of provisions on the middle shelf and the structure is not complaining also it is not leaning swaying or bending due to this load so safe to assume that the weight added per shelf is comfy5 besides shear strength sturdiness the shelves can be cleaned as it is ss space obtained from the assembled unit is humongousa couple of nice to have points1 weight bearing lockable castor wheels would have been even more fantastic2 the shelves are made up of steel rods like in modular kitchen drawers 1 or 2 shelves with solid ss base plates without gaps would have been helpful as per my observationthat said this unit is sturdy provides utility and vfm in a single package hence is a good buyread more,0.9788,Positive
